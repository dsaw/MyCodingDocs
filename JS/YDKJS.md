* Up & Going - Part 1
  * Try it yourself - Start a blank browser tab and open developer console. This plain console is where the Javaascript code is run.
  * Javascript is commonly called an interpreted language but it is not entirely accurate. Javascript engine makes use of a JIT compiler that will run compiled code *on the fly*.
  * To output on the console, type out `console.log(msg)`
  * To generate alert boxes, type out `alert(msg)`
  * To accept input from user, run `prompt(msg)`. The prompt will display a text box for user to fill in. Then the user input is returned as a string.
  * Defining a block also makes a *scope* with it aka *lexical scope*. A scope is a collection of variables and rules to show how to access those variables. 
      * Code inside a block can only access variables in its scope and the scope outside it. 
     
  * Javascript has the following built-in types: string, number, boolean, null and undefined, object and symbol in ES6. Only values have types in JS, variables are just containers.
