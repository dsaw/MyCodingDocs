## YDKJS 
* Up & Going - Part 1
  * Try it yourself - Start a blank browser tab and open developer console. This plain console is where the Javaascript code is run.
  * Javascript is commonly called an interpreted language but it is not entirely accurate. Javascript engine makes use of a JIT compiler that will run compiled code *on the fly*.
  * To output on the console, type out `console.log(msg)`
  * To generate alert boxes, type out `alert(msg)`
  * To accept input from user, run `prompt(msg)`. The prompt will display a text box for user to fill in. Then the user input is returned as a string.
